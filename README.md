## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Starts the app on http://localhost:3000 by default.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
